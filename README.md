# Tree Diagrams App Project

A school project about calculating probabilities by using tree diagrams.

This app works as a kickstarter for the full standalone "Calculating Probabilities By Using Tree Diagrams" web project.

Comes packaged with all the files of the web project. (see current version for more details)

The web files are too many for uploading to the app directory, so they are packaged separately in the "webproject.zip" file. (see current version for more details)


CURRENT VERSION : 0.4

Current version uses assets system. (Extracted to "/sdcard/Android/data/com.mma.probability/TreeDiagrams")
The "webproject.zip" includes the assets folder, which is to be extracted to "app/src/main/java/assets" in app source.

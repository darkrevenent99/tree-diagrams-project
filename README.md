# tree-diagrams-project
A school project about calculating probabilities by using tree diagrams.

This app works as a kickstarter for the full "Calculating Probabilities By Using Tree Diagrams" web project.

Comes packaged with all the files of the web project. (see current version for more details)

The web files are too many for uploading to the app directory, so they WILL BE (not yet) packaged separately in the "webproject.zip" file. (see current version for more details)


CURRENT VERSION : 0.3

Current version uses assets external files system. (Unfinished Coding)

The "webproject.zip" WILL (not yet) include the assets folder, which is to be extracted to "app/src/main/java/assets".
